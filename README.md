# Kathak Dance Movement Recognition and Correction Using Google's Mediapipe

## Project Overview

This project, undertaken from September 2022, focuses on Kathak dance movement recognition and correction using Google's Mediapipe technology. We have developed a real-time posture detection system that offers a learning software solution for Indian classical dance. This system tracks body, hand, and facial landmarks from video frames using Python and OpenCV. The results of this project have been significant and have been recognized by the academic community with the acceptance of a detailed technical paper by the 14th ICCCNT IEEE Conference.
